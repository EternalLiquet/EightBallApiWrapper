![Eight Ball Picture](https://freepngimg.com/thumb/8_ball_pool/26906-7-8-ball-pool-transparent.png)

Don't want to write your own implementation of the 8Ball Delegator API? Want to simply instantiate an object that will do it for you? The 8Ball Delegator Wrapper is here! API Docs found here: https://8ball.delegator.com/

### Usage Example

#### From a synchronous function

```cs
using System;
using EightBallApiWrapper;

namespace Example
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            EightBall eightBall = new EightBall();
            var result = eightBall.AskQuestion("Should I make this totally financially irresponsible decision?");
            Console.WriteLine(result.Result.magic.answer);
            //This will be phased out in the future as I make separate async and synchronous functions!
        }
    }
}
```

#### From an asynchronous function

```cs
using System;
using EightBallApiWrapper;

namespace Example
{
    public class CoolClass
    {
        public async void AskEightBallExample
        {
            EightBall eightBall = new EightBall();
            var result = await eightBall.AskQuestion("Should I make this totally financially irresponsible decision?");
            Console.WriteLine(result.magic.answer);
            //This will be phased out in the future as I make separate async and synchronous functions!
        }
    }
}
```

### Result Class Structure:

```javascript
result: (object){
    magic: (object){
        question: string //returns your initial question
        answer: string //returns the answer to your yes/no question
        type: string [ Affirmative, Contrary, Neutral ] //a string that will be either "Affirmative", "Contrary", or "Neutral" that denotes what kind of answer you received.
    }
}
```

### Benefits Of Using This Library:

Boils the process of writing the implementation of the Eight Ball Delegator API to 3 lines. Import. Instantiate. Ask.
